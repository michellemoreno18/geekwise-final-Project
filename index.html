        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p id="first-paragraph">
            Established in Montebello, Segundo Books and Coffee is a space for students of all ages to do school work, research new topics, beginning projects, or reading in a cozy atmosphere. With Segundo having three floors, students are able to socialize and have a cup of coffee on the first floor. At the coffee shop, we serve breakfast, brunch, pastries, and of course, coffee! On the main floor we sell used books and Segundo merchandise. The second floor is dedicated to studying or reading. The second floor offers multiple study rooms, conference rooms, and a computer lab ready to be reserved for class projects, club meetings, or zoom calls. The floor contains multiple printers and IT students for any tech assistance. Lastly, the third floor is the quiet zone for students who prefer a quiet environment. We designed the building with the intention of helping students concentrate on their studies and encourage them to continue their education. Segundo was inspired by students from Montebello who noticed the importance of study spaces and accessibility for many students of the area.
